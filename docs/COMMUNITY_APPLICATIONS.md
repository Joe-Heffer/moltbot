# Community Applications

The Moltbot community has produced creative applications beyond the core use cases. The [awesome-moltbot-skills](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-moltbot-skills) repository catalogues 700+ skills across 28 categories.

## Notable Community Examples

- **Autonomous restaurant reservations.** A user asked Moltbot to book a restaurant. When the bot could not use OpenTable, it autonomously acquired AI voice software and phoned the restaurant to make the reservation.

- **Kanban board generation.** Within an hour of initial setup, a user's Moltbot instance had built a fully featured kanban board for task assignment without step-by-step instructions.

- **Tesla fleet management.** Community skills allow locking, unlocking, climate control, charge monitoring, and vehicle location through conversational commands.

- **3D printer monitoring.** Skills connect to OctoPrint and similar controllers to monitor print jobs, adjust temperatures, and send completion notifications.

- **Meal planning and grocery delivery.** Users have built workflows that generate weekly meal plans, create shopping lists, and place grocery delivery orders.

- **Multi-agent orchestration.** Advanced setups use Moltbot's sessions API to run multiple agents in parallel -- one monitoring email, another managing calendar, and a third coordinating between them.
