# Cost Expectations

Moltbot itself is free and open source (MIT license). The primary ongoing cost is LLM API usage:

| Usage Level | Monthly Estimate | Typical Profile |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Light | $10 -- $30 | Occasional queries, simple tasks |
| Moderate | $30 -- $70 | Daily use, multi-channel, background tasks |
| Heavy | $70 -- $150 | Continuous operation, multi-agent workflows |

Anthropic's Claude Pro or Max subscriptions can be used as an alternative to per-token API billing. VPS hosting adds $4 -- $24/month depending on provider and RAM. Cloudflare Workers deployment runs at approximately $5/month.
